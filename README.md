# List-Comprehension
Demonstration of List Comprehension


# Motivation
I wrote this program to demonstrate some methods I learned to shorten code. There is five permutations of code that will return the squares of a list of numbers.


# How to use?
Use an IDE to:
- Run the script.
- Verify all 5 methods produce the same result


# Contribute
Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome.
